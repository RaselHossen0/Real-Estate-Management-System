**Project Description**: This project is a JavaFX application that utilizes MySQL as its database. It aims to provide [briefly explain the purpose or functionality of your application].

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your Linux system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- MySQL Server

## Setting Up MySQL

To set up MySQL on your Linux system, please follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Update the package list by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. Install the MySQL Server package by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mysql-server
   ```

4. During the installation process, you will be prompted to set a password for the MySQL root user. Choose a secure password and remember it.

5. Once the installation is complete, start the MySQL service by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo service mysql start
   ```

6. To secure your MySQL installation, run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

   Follow the prompts and answer the questions to set up security measures for your MySQL installation.

7. You can now access the MySQL server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter the password you set during the installation process.

8. Once logged in to the MySQL server, create a new database for your project by running the following command:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
   ```

   Replace `your_database_name` with the desired name for your database.

9. Optionally, create a new user and grant necessary privileges to the user for the database. This step is recommended for better security and separation of concerns. Run the following commands to create a new user and grant privileges:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'your_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database_name.* TO 'your_username'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

   Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your desired username and password for the database.

10. Exit the MySQL prompt by running the following command:

    ```sql
    EXIT;
    ```

## Configuring the Project

To configure the project to use your MySQL database, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

2. Locate the database configuration file. It might be named `config.properties` or similar.

3. Open the configuration file and update the following properties with your MySQL database information:

   ```properties
   db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
   db.username=your_username
   db.password=your_password
   ```

   Replace `your_database_name`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with the respective values you set during the MySQL setup.

4. Save the configuration file.

## Running the Project

Once you have completed the setup steps, you can now run the project. Follow these instructions:

1. Build the project using your IDE's build or compile command.

2. Run the project using your IDE's run or execute command.

3. The JavaFX application should start, and you can interact with it according to its functionality.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during the MySQL setup, refer to the official MySQL documentation or search for solutions specific to your Linux distribution.
- If you face problems related to connecting to the MySQL database from the project, double-check the database configuration properties in the project and ensure
